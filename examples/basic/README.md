# Basic Model Example

This example `model` package contains a valid DSL describing the example used
in the README of the repo.

## Usage

The example can be uploaded to the Structurizr service using the `stz`
command line tool (see the
[README](https://github.com/goadesign/model/tree/master/README.md) for
details on installing and using the tool).

```bash
stz put goa.design/model/examples/basic/model -id ID -key KEY -secret SECRET
```

where `ID` is the Structurizr workspace ID, `KEY` is the Structurizr API key
and `SECRET` the correpsonding secret.
