# JSON Model Example

This example `model` package contains a valid DSL definition of a simple
software system that makes use of the `Endpoint` and `Calls` DSLs. The
main function in the `main` package serializes the underlying model as
JSON and prints it to standard output.

## Usage

To run this example, execute the following from the examples/json
directory:

```
go run main.go
```

This will print the model as JSON to standard output.
